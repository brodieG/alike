Title: Determine Whether Two Objects Are Similar
Description: Provides a suite of functions that allows comparison of the
    structure of objects rather than their values.  This is particularly useful
    when one has an object template (e.g. matrix(integer(), ncol=3)) that they
    wish to compare other objects against (e.g. three column integer matrices)
