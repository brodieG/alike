Title: Determine Whether Two Objects Are Similar
Description: Compares object structures rather than values.  This is
    particularly useful when a user has an object template (e.g.
    matrix(integer(), ncol=3)) that they wish to compare other objects against
    (e.g. three column integer matrices).
