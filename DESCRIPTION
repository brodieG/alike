Title: Determine Whether Two Objects Are Similar
Description: Compares object structures rather than values.  This is
    particularly useful when one has an object template (e.g. matrix(integer(),
    ncol=3)) that they wish to compare other objects against (e.g. three column
    integer matrices).
