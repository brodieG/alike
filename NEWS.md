alike 1.2.0
===========

* Deprecation
* Fixes related to function comparison (#38, #37) and other misc (#36)

alike 1.1.0
===========

* Improvements to error message so that user can just copy paste relevant part 
  of error message in prompt and see what the problem object is (fix 
  issues #26, #32, #35)
    * Use substituted `current` expression
    * Use accessor functions to problem item (e.g. `names(abc$b[[1]])`)

alike 1.0.0
===========

API Breaking Changes:

* `alike` no longer accepts any parameters outside of `target` and `current`; if
  you wish to change the previously existing settings use `.alike` and
  `alike_settings` instead.

Behavior Changes:

* We now only check small numeric vectors for integerness to avoid scanning
  through large numeric vectors to confirm they are integer like (you can
  re-enable this using the `max.fuzzy.int.len` parameter).
* Added support for additional recursive objects: environments, pairlists, and
  expressions are now recursed through, with `alike` applied recursively to each
  elemment therein; this mirrors the previous treatment for lists (the VECSXP
  type)
* Levels are compared like names (#23)
* Improved comparison of language objects (calls, symbols, formulas, and
  functions); see docs for explanations of what makes language objects alike
  (#10, #11, #14, #16)
* Attributes are now recursively compared with `alike` as well instead of
  `identical`
* Added `abstract` functions to assist in the creation of template objects (#9)
* `ts` class objects now have specialized comparison
* Error messages generally tweaked

Other:

* Documentation updates
* Vignette overhaul

Internal Changes:

* C level optimizations (#7, #13, but #13 not complete)
* Several small unreported bugs

alike 0.2.5
===========

* Doc updates
* removed C library files to allow installs on platforms with different
  compilers

alike 0.2.4
===========

* NULLs are only wildcard when nested inside other objects

alike 0.2.3
===========

* Clearer error messages focus on highest level differences first (e.g. class)
* `names`/`row.names` may now be shorter in `target` than `current`
* major internal re-structuring; should be transparent to user

**NOTE**: `alike` will likely cease to exist as a stand alone package and become part of `validate` at some point in the future.  If this happens the interface will be unchanged, but the functions will be in a different package.

alike 0.2.2
===========

* Internal changes to support `validate`

alike 0.2.1
===========

* Now unloading dynamic libraries on package unload (Fixes #1), though some
  questions as to whether this introduces other issues when loading/unloading
  same package (happened once, can't reproduce).

alike 0.2
=========

* Primarily moved to C based computations to run faster
* Lost some functionality in the process of doing the above
