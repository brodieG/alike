These are internal developer notes; don't expect any of it to make much sense.

## Garbage Collection

### What Should Be PROTECTed

`SEXP` that you create must be protected

### How Does Protection Work

**Note**: a lot of what follows is somewhat untested

Protection is purely a function of the protection stack; the following two are equivalent (assuming GC cant happen between the two statements in the second point):

* `x = PROTECT(ScalarLogical(1));`
* `x = ScalarLogical(1); PROTECT()`

A corollary of the above is that it is often useful to use spurious `PROTECT` calls to maintain stack balance in forked logic:

    if(i > 5) w = PROTECT(ScalarLogical(1)); ...
    else PROTECT(); ...
    ...
    UNPROTECT(1);  // Otherwise would have to unprotect 0 or 1 depending on logic above

### When Is Protection Not Necessary?

Only SEXPs that are not pointed to by protected SEXPs need to be protected, for example in:

    x = PROTECT(list2(ScalarLogical(1), ScalarLogical(2)));
    y = CAR(x);
    z = CADR(x);

We don't need to `PROTECT` `y` or `z` as they are already protected as members of `x`.

Also, assuming `z` is protected already:

    SETCDR(z, list1(scalarLogical(1)));

Does not require any protection even though we are creating two new `SEXP`s because `z` is already protected and `z` will point to its CDR, obviously.

SEXPs that are created within the initialization script `R_init_...` and are `install`ed don't need to be protected, likely because those become pointed to by the symbol table.  It is possible to initialize other objects but these seem to get GCed (in particular, we attempted to create calls with nested sub-objects).

## Output / Inspection

void Rprintf(const char *, ...);
void REprintf(const char *, ...);
  like `Rprintf`, but prints to stderr!

void PrintValue(SEXP)
  equivalent to `print` in R!

void error(const char *, ...);
  equivalent to `stop` in R, always has for context the function that initially `.Call` the R code.


## Conversions

SEXP mkString(const char *s)
  return: STRSXP, equivalent to ScalarString(mkChar(x))

SEXP ScalarString(SEXP):
  param: should be CHARSXP, i.e. `ScalarString(mkChar(x))`
  return: STRSXP

SEXP PRINTNAME(SEXP)
  param: should be a pairlist tag (e.g `TAG(X)`), presumably a symbol
  return: CHARSXP
  can potentially convert to STRSXP with: `ScalarString(PRINTNAME(TAG(x)))`

SEXP asChar(x):
  param: STRSXP
  return: CHARSXP, first element in x

From TAG to R object:
  ScalarString(PRINTNAME(TAG(x)))

From Hadley:

There are a few helper functions that turn length one R vectors into C scalars:

    asLogical(x): LGLSXP -> int
    asInteger(x): INTSXP -> int
    asReal(x): REALSXP -> double
    CHAR(asChar(x)): STRSXP -> const char*

And helpers to go in the opposite direction:

    ScalarLogical(x): int -> LGLSXP
    ScalarInteger(x): int -> INTSXP
    ScalarReal(x): double -> REALSXP
    mkString(x): const char* -> STRSXP

## NA values

From arith.h:

    #define NA_LOGICAL  R_NaInt
    #define NA_INTEGER  R_NaInt
    /* #define NA_FACTOR  R_NaInt  unused */
    #define NA_REAL   R_NaReal

## Hash Tables vs Simple Lookup

One question is whether using hash tables makes sense for lookups on things that are likely to be reasonably small.  Here are some tests of various sizes.  We're using the pfhash hash tables:

    x <- do.call(paste, expand.grid(letters, letters, letters))
    y <- do.call(paste, expand.grid(LETTERS, LETTERS, LETTERS))
    names(x) <- x
    names(y) <- x
    x.0 <- as.pairlist(x[1:10])
    y.0 <- as.pairlist(y[1:10])
    x.1 <- as.pairlist(x[1:25])
    y.1 <- as.pairlist(y[1:25])
    x.2 <- as.pairlist(x[1:50])
    y.2 <- as.pairlist(y[1:50])
    x.3 <- as.pairlist(x[1:100])
    y.3 <- as.pairlist(y[1:100])
    x.4 <- as.pairlist(x[1:200])
    y.4 <- as.pairlist(y[1:200])
    microbenchmark(
      alike_test(x.0, y.0, 1),
      alike_test(x.0, y.0, 0),
      alike_test(x.1, y.1, 1),
      alike_test(x.1, y.1, 0),
      alike_test(x.2, y.2, 1),
      alike_test(x.2, y.2, 0),
      alike_test(x.3, y.3, 1),
      alike_test(x.3, y.3, 0),
      alike_test(x.4, y.4, 1),
      alike_test(x.4, y.4, 0)
    )

0 indicates no hash table.  This suggests up to about ~25 elements we're better off not using a hash table due to the associated overhead...  Additionally, it looks like `xlength` takes about 1ns per element in list to operate, so maybe the correct way to do this is to check length, and if greater than 25, use hash, else just do a double loop.  Or even better than `xlenght`, just use a loop to count length up to 25, adds a little overhead if list is small, but probably as soon as we get above 50 `for` wins.
