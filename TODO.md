* environment comparison issues; these change every time we load a session

# Optimize!!!

* Currently working in C, looks promising.
* Make sure all the safety / infinite loop stuff and stack re-allocation is implemented

# Random Notes

ref: 1L   # integer
cur: 1.0  # numeric, integer like

ref: 1.0  # numeric, integer like
cur: 1L   # 

Are these two levels really distinct:
- Integers can be consider numeric no matter what
- Integer like numerics are integers

Basically, is there a situation where you would like integers to be accepted as
numeric, but not the other way around?  In addition to having the option of also
allowing integer like numerics to be treated as numeric?

int.strict = integers can only match integers

* 1L, 1.0 # FALSE
* 1.0, 1L # FALSE

int.loose = integers can be numeric

* 1L, 1.0 # FALSE
* 1.0, 1L # TRUE

int.super.loose = integer like numerics can be integers

* 1L, 1.0 # TRUE
* 1.0, 1L # TRUE

# Things to test

## alike.c

* Make sure our use of `flags` argument to R_compute_identical() is correct
* Test that our decision to use direct comparison or `rownames` attribute isn't
  a disaster
* can we track down the really weird error that popped up relating to some part
  of memory.C running into unknown type ANYSXP that happened right after our
  changes to have type_alike_internal return character?  After that `unitizer`
  was totally messed up; clearly something got over-written in memory, but can't
  replicate error anymore.
