# Bugs?

ARE THERE ANY PROBLEMS WHEN TESTING EXPRESSIONS? I.E. ARE WE TESTING THE
EXPRESSION THE USER PASSED AS AN ARGUMENT, OR THE EVALUATION OF THAT
EXPRESSION?  I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE IN THIS
CASE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO RETRIEVE THE UNEVALUATED EXPRESSION, BUT NEED 
TO MAKE SURE DUE TO WEIRD STUFF SUCH AS 5 ACTUALLY BEING AN EXPRESSION
IN ADDITION TO AN INTEGER.

NEED TO TEST ALL MODIFICATIONS TO alike.default AND alike.call.  FOR THE LATTER NEED
O CHECK THAT reduce_to_funs DOESN'T STRIP ATTRIBUTES, ETC.  ALSO, NEED TO CHECK
THAT WE GET DESIRED OUTCOMES FOR ALL THE ALIKE METHODS

NEED TO FIX THE ERROR THROWING IN CHECKARGS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EDITING CONDITIONS!!!

## alike.call

Problems with `make_comp_fun` gone missing
