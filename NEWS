alike 0.2.1
===========

* Now unloading dynamic libraries on package unload (Fixes #1), though some
  questions as to whether this introduces other issues when loading/unloading
  same package (happened once, can't reproduce).

alike 0.2
=========

* Primarily moved to C based computations to run faster
* Lost some functionality in the process of doing the above
